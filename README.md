# BerlinDB

BerlinDB is a collection of PHP classes and methods provides an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_mapping">ORM</a>-like experience & interface to database tables in WordPress.

The most common use-case for BerlinDB is a WordPress Plugin that needs to create custom database tables, but more advanced uses are possible, including managing and interfacing with the WordPress Core database tables themselves.

## Mission

The primary mission of BerlinDB is to democratize data storage.

### Phase 1
Reduce the overall labor required to perform routine & repetitive database interactions.

### Phase 2
Achieve platform agnosticism through smart abstractions and interoperability layers.

### Phase 3
Generate the custom code that is necessary from any existing database table structure.

### Phase 4
Automate database table structure changes for a seamless upgrade/rollback experience.

### Phase 5
Manage all database connections to directly support reads, writes, clones, splitting, and sharding.

## Name

The name of this project comes from [WordCamp Europe 2019](https://europe.wordcamp.org/2019/) â€“ which took place in the beautiful & historic capital city of Berlin, Germany â€“ where it was <a href="https://jjj.blog/wceu-2019/">originally exhibited & announced</a> as an unnamed utility being used by the Sandhills Development engineering team.

<a href="https://peterwilson.cc">Peter Wilson</a> recommended naming it "Berlin" to commemorate everyone in attendance for its unveiling.

## Story

The code in this repository represents the cumulative effort of dozens of individuals across multiple projects, spanning multiple continents, native languages, and years of conceptual development & iteration:

* BuddyPress (<a href="https://buddypress.org">inspired by</a>)
* WordPress Multisite (<a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/components/networks-sites/">inspired by</a>)
* Easy Digital Downloads (<a href="https://github.com/easydigitaldownloads/easy-digital-downloads/tree/release/3.0">3.0 and higher</a>)
* Sugar Calendar (<a href="https://github.com/sugarcalendar/sugar-event-calendar-lite">2.0 and higher</a>)
* Restrict Content Pro (<a href="https://github.com/restrictcontentpro">3.1 and higher</a>)
